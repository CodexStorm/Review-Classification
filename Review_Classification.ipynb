Given the vocabulary list, we can now map each word in the preprocessed emails into a list of word indices that contains the index of the word in the vocabulary list. In the code, we are giving a string str which is a single word from the processed review. We then look up the word in the vocabulary list vocabList and find if the word exists in the vocabulary list. If the word exists, we then add the index of the word into the word indices variable. If the word does not exist, and is therefore not in the vocabulary, we skip the word.

In other words, a single *decision tree* tends to be over-fitting for the massive amount of data we are processing. Due to the scope of this assignment, we only implemented a single decision tree as a proof-of-concept, but a more elaborative *random forest* would be preferred for later iterations."

    "\n",
    "The opinion spam problem is very important because deceitful reviews, both positive and negative can have a large impact on whatever it is they are reviewing. This includes fake reviews drawing customers to a competitor if they are flooded by fake positive reviews or pushing customers away if your own reviews are filled with fake bad reviews. To that end, there are quite a bit of research resources already available on the topic. A paper on **Survey On Opinion Spam Detection Methods** does a great job of summarizing many of these works. In the paper, three approaches to spam detection are introduced, these are detection using review features, reviewer features, and spammer group detection. Our approach falls into the review features as we are looking at each review individually and trying to draw correlations between the reviews. Many of these approaches report similar accuracy results when working with their own data sets, but these tend to struggle when tested on real-world data. Our models would likely follow this trend as well. The other approaches sound very intriguing as well looking at behavioral patterns of review spammers as well as spammer groups in the hopes of pinpointing when they are most active. This only includes a small subset of work on the subject as there are quite a few to begin with.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the results we have shown, the SVM and MLP models tend to perform better on the data that we have been given. The SVM and MLP models both achieve close to **90%** accuracy on our testing split which is a solid number. The decision tree on the other hand achieves around **70%** accuracy. The reason for this could be that the decision tree is overfit on the training data or possibly there aren't enough features available for the decision tree to be as successful as it can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **Conclusion/Future Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a lot of study on detecting fraudulent and misleading reviews and separating them from genuine, accurate ones. We reviewed the majority of the available research on opinion spam identification using machine learning and natural language processing for this study. The goal of this research was to get a better understanding of existing research on methods and machine learning approaches that have been employed in the past, as well as to give future insights to researchers. Future work on this project would be trying to diversify our training data. This would hopefully allow us to make models that would perform well on any form of opinion spam and give a better model overall. We could also look into generating more features with some more domain knowledge about linguistic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because websites like Yelp and Dianping have built-in filters that detect fraudulent reviews flawlessly, data from these platforms can be useful in developing an accurate model for detecting opinion spam. Because manually identifying real-world spam is difficult, if not impossible, teaching AI to learn from human-written evaluations and generate comparable reviews is one technique to create a dataset that reflects real-time opinion spam. For the categorization of false reviews, the focus might be on training neural networks and deep neural networks. Even while some machine learning algorithms outperform neural networks on smaller data sets, neural networks will become increasingly important in the categorization of such large amounts of data as views on websites grow."
